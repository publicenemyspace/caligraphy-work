        <p><strong>Calligraphy</strong> (from Greek: καλλιγραφία) is a visual art related to writing. It is the design and execution of lettering with a broad-tipped instrument, brush, or other writing instrument. A contemporary calligraphic practice can
            be defined as "the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious, and skillful manner".</p>

        <p>Modern calligraphy ranges from functional inscriptions and designs to fine-art pieces where the letters may or may not be readable.Classical calligraphy differs from typography and non-classical hand-lettering, though a calligrapher may practice
            both.
        </p>

        <p>Calligraphy continues to flourish in the forms of wedding invitations and event invitations, font design and typography, original hand-lettered logo design, religious art, announcements, graphic design and commissioned calligraphic art, cut stone
            inscriptions, and memorial documents. It is also used for props and moving images for film and television, and also for testimonials, birth and death certificates, maps, and other written works.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <br>

        <p>In ancient China, the oldest Chinese characters existing are Jiǎgǔwén characters (甲骨文) carved on ox scapulae and tortoise plastrons, because the dominators in Shang Dynasty carved pits on such animals' bones and then baked them to gain auspice
            of military affairs, agricultural harvest, or even procreating and weather. During the divination ceremony, after the cracks were made, the characters were written with a brush on the shell or bone to be later carved. (Keightley, 1978). With
            the development of Jīnwén (Bronzeware script) and Dàzhuàn "cursive" signs continued. Mao Gong Ding is one of the most famous and typical Bronzeware scripts in the Chinese calligraphy history. It has 500 characters on the bronze which is the
            largest number of bronze inscription we have discovered so far.[15] Moreover, each archaic kingdom of current China had its own set of characters.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>In Imperial China, the graphs on old steles—some dating from 200 BC, and in Xiaozhuan style—are still accessible.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            About 220 BC, the emperor Qin Shi Huang, the first to conquer the entire Chinese basin, imposed several reforms, among them Li Si's character unification, which created a set of 3300 standardized Xiǎozhuàn（小篆） characters.[16] Despite the fact that the
            main writing implement of the time was already the brush, few papers survive from this period, and the main examples of this style are on steles.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The Lìshū style (隸書/隸书)(clerical script) which is more regularized, and in some ways similar to modern text, have been also authorised under Qin Shi Huangdi.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Between clerical script and traditional regular script, there is another transition type of calligraphy works called Wei Bei. It had started at the South and North dynasty and ended before Tang Dynasty.
        </p>
        <br>
        <P>
            Kǎishū style (traditional regular script)—still in use today—and attributed to Wang Xizhi (王羲之, 303–361) and his followers, is even more regularized. Its spread was encouraged by Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang (926–933), who ordered the printing of the
            classics using new wooden blocks in Kaishu. Printing technologies here allowed a shape stabilization. The Kaishu shape of characters 1000 years ago was mostly similar to that at the end of Imperial China. But small changes have been made,
            for example in the shape of 广 which is not absolutely the same in the Kangxi Dictionary of 1716 as in modern books. The Kangxi and current shapes have tiny differences, while stroke order is still the same, according to old style.
        </P>
        <br>
        <p>
            Styles which did not survive include Bāfēnshū, a mix made of Xiaozhuan style at 80%, and Lishu at 20%. Some variant Chinese characters were unorthodox or locally used for centuries. They were generally understood but always rejected in official texts.
            Some of these unorthodox variants, in addition to some newly created characters, compose the Simplified Chinese character set.

                The word “Calligraphy” is derived from Greek, meaning “beautiful writing”. Calligraphy or the art of fancy writing
                has
                thousands of years in its history and development. They are of aesthetics, refinement, creativity and pure beauty.
                For
                different scripts, for example, Chinese or Arabic, they have developed their own way of calligraphy. However, either
                western calligraphy or Chinese or Arabic calligraphy, they have strict rules and shapes with a geometrical order of
                lining on the page, each character with a precise stroke order.
